# Whole wheat pancakes

## Ingredients
+ 2 cups white whole wheat flour, I use King Arthur
+ 4 1/2 tsp baking powder
+ 1/2 tsp kosher salt
+ 2 tsp ground cinnamon
+ 2 tsp sugar
+ 2 large eggs
+ 2 cups + 2 tbsp fat free milk
+ 2 tsp vanilla extract
+ cooking spray

## Instructions
Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl. Add wet ingredients to the mixing bowl and mix well with a spoon until there are no more dry spots; don't over-mix.
Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Lightly spray oil to coat and pour 1/4 cup of pancake batter. When the pancake starts to bubble, you may add your fruit if you wish. When the bubbles settle and the edges begin to set, flip the pancakes. Repeat with the remainder of the batter. Makes 14 pancakes.
